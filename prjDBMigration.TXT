The cab file for your application has been built as 'D:\Suresh\Development\DB Migration\Package\MoveData v2.0.CAB'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (D:\Suresh\Development\DB Migration\Package\Support\MoveData v2.0.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab file in case you make changes to some of the files.
